# Hospital Readmission Analysis (Healthcare Data Analytics)

## 📌 Overview
Hospital readmissions are a major driver of healthcare costs and patient outcomes. This project analyzes 30-day hospital readmission patterns to identify high-risk patient groups and operational factors associated with readmissions.

## 🎯 Business Questions
- Which patient groups have the highest readmission rates?
- Do length of stay and comorbidities influence readmissions?
- Are there seasonal or demographic patterns in readmission risk?

## 🛠 Tools & Skills
- **SQL**: joins, aggregations, filtering
- **Python**: pandas, numpy, matplotlib
- **Power BI**: dashboards and KPIs
- **Healthcare Metrics**: LOS, readmission rate

## 📂 Dataset
`data/hospital_readmissions.csv` (synthetic, realistic structure for portfolio use)

## 📊 Key Metrics
- 30-day readmission rate
- Average length of stay (LOS)
- Readmissions by diagnosis and discharge destination
- Monthly readmission trends

## 📈 Dashboard
See `dashboards/POWER_BI_LAYOUT.md` for the recommended layout and measures.

## 🧠 Insights (example)
- Older patients show higher readmission rates
- Longer LOS is correlated with higher readmission risk
- CHF/Sepsis cohorts trend higher risk

## 💡 Recommendations (example)
- Target post-discharge follow-ups for high-risk groups
- Optimize discharge planning for long-stay patients
- Use risk flags to prioritize care coordination
